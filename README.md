# „Ä∞Ô∏è About the Toolkit „Ä∞Ô∏è
#### An open source teaching resource for exploring Distributed Design

The toolkit has been developed from [Other Today](https://www.other.today)‚Äôs teaching on the [Distributed Design Studio](https://wikifactory.com/+othertodaystudio) at [Brighton University](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/courses/study/product-design-with-professional-experience-bsc-hons.aspx) and has been developed with the support of the [Distributed Design Platform](https://distributeddesign.eu), co-funded by the[ Creative Europe Program](https://ec.europa.eu/culture/creative-europe) of the European Union.&#x20;

It features four guest resources from inspiring design studios covering [manifestos](direction/your-graphic-identity.md#making-your-manifesto), [bio materials](design/experiment-+-record.md#contents), [batch production](introduction/batch.works.md#contents) and [DIY documentation](distribution/documenting-your-work-1.md#contents).

This toolkit is intended to grow and distributed design educators are invited to add to it. It is intended to be seen as an additional resource to other design methods out there such as [design thinking](https://www.designkit.org) and [circular design](https://www.circulardesignguide.com)

## üè† Structure

The toolkit is split into three thematic sections, **Direction**, **Design** and **Distribution**. The content can be approached in any order, for example you may want to start by learning about supply chains (a part of distribution) while at the same time developing values (in direction)

This toolkit builds on the double diamond model of a designer‚Äôs workflow and on top of topics in the established **Design** phase it introduces activities to encourage designers to think about their **Direction** before a project (their values, vision and mission) and alternatives for the **Distribution** of the materials, value and knowledge of their design after a product is launched.

## :dart: Direction

Direction is the 'Why' of a project. It is an understanding that design is about more than just products. It needs to consider the system that it is operating within and connect this to the designer's vision and values they want to manifest. The toolkit includes activities in

* The ethics of design and sustainability and developing a set of values and design principles&#x20;
* Setting out a hopeful vision of the future into which designers can imagine their near and far future to set their mission.&#x20;
* A willingness to get lost - it is a designers job to learn how to find out about themselves, the local situation and the wider global context in order to Identify a specialism or approach that is individual to the designer.&#x20;

## ‚úèÔ∏è Design

Design is the "How" of a project and in distributed design this phase should follow the established methods as set out in frameworks such as the double diamond. This toolkit includes activities that distributed designers could do to improve their design and research such as:

* Starting with making, some problems can be explored quicker and deeper when thinking with your hands.&#x20;
* Mapping contexts and local manufacturing.&#x20;
* Ideation via materials and manufacturing methods&#x20;

## üöö Distribution

‚ÄòDistribution‚Äô in Distributed Design refers to several things

* firstly exploring alternative ways of getting products to people such as sending data, using local materials and making them with digital fabrication instead of shipping materials and goods globally from factory to consumer.
* Secondly the distribution of value, knowledge and power as Kate Raworth argues; a new economy is required that is regenerative and re-distributive by design. This toolkit looks at alternative business models and the open sourcing of instructions and sharing of learning through publishing lab books, and methods online.
* Thirdly the distribution of material in circular flows considering a material‚Äôs life cycle. This toolkit encourages design for the next use and the use of pre-used materials in new products.
